# Refactor Tractor - What's Cookin' (B)
Mod 2 FE Refactoring Project


## Overview
This project is enforcing the practices of refactoring a project in a codebase that the team members did not design and was unfamiliar to them. It covered aspects of converting network requests to remote APIs, utilizing a separate domUpdates files, ensuring best practices for user-accessibility, and incorporating webpack to streamline files. 

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - CSS/SCSS
  - HTML5

## Wins
	- Each member has a sound understanding of the code that was written and refactored, a better understanding of APIs, as well as a clearer understanding of the purpose of webpack
  - Improving the website Lighthouse score from 66 to 100
  - Writing and passing tests for each Class file

## Challenges + Improvements
	- Navigating through unfamiliar code and making sense of the original repository
	- Dividing the work content throughout the team
	- Future Iterations include the full functionality of connecting the newly written methods, resizing content on the recipe card, adding costs of materials and recipes to the recipe card, updating the user's quantity of a particular panty ingredient, incorporate SASS and DRYing up the CSS file, and improving the HTML structure to increase WAVE accessibility.
